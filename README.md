After cloning this repository, you need to initiate a virtual environment. Then install necessary packages within it.

1. Go to project directory
```console
cd phitron-django-004
```
Here `library_management_project` is the project folder, where the `settings.py` is the root settings file for the whole project, `urls.py` is the main url pattern handler. (CEO Shaheb üòâ)    


2. Run the command given below to create a virtual environment within the .venv directory
```console
# For Linux/MacOS
python3 -m venv .venv
```

```console
# For Windows
python -m venv .venv
```
**You need to do this once, after cloning the project. .venv folder is ignored within .gitignore file**    


3. Now run the command below to activate the virtual environment.
```console
# For Linux/MacOS
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```console
# For Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```


4. Now run this once to install all the packages
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


5. You are good to go. To start the development server, simply run
```console
python manage.py runserver
```
**Important [‚ùó]: The server no longer runs on the default port `8000`. Instead, it runs on port `10000` since render supports this port. Simply open `http://127.0.0.1:10000` to se the development server**

**Important [‚ùó]: manage.py file is modified to run `10000` as the default port.**

**Make sure you are within the right directory by entering `ls` or `dir` command to check if manage.py exists**
